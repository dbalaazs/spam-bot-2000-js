# spam-bot-2000-js
Spam bot 2000 is an open-source discord bot. It currently has a couple commands, but you can write your own.
## The current commands:
### -sp or shitpost: This commands can spam a specified message (now even with spaces) and repost it up to 50 times
(I've noticed stability issues with more messages, but you can manually change it)
### -tanarur: It joins you voice channel and plays a .mp3 file. To use this you have to make a misc folder with the file inside titled "tanarur.mp3" or alternatively you can change it's name in the code
### -help: This is just a basic help menu (it list out the possible commands in text)
### -pog: It replies with champ
## Installing the bot:
#### 1: You have to copy the code into your editor
#### 2: You have to write in your terminal: npm install (This will install the necessary packages)
#### 3: You have to make a config.json file, put in your token and a prefix (this site runs you through the process of getting your token pretty well: https://www.writebots.com/discord-bot-token/)
#### 4: Run the bot :)

An example for config.json:
{
    "token": "your token",
    "prefix": "-"
}
